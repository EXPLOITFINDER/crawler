Advanced Web Crawler is a powerful, fully automated crawling tool built with Node.js, Puppeteer, and Cheerio. Designed for security researchers, penetration testers, and bug bounty hunters, it simulates real browser behavior to extract valuable information from web applications in depth.

This tool intelligently analyzes websites, collects links, forms, and endpoints, and performs recursive exploration — all while handling client-side rendering and modern JavaScript content.
